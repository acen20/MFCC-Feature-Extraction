# Quick note
For each type of sound, create a directory or folder in the audio/ directory.
<br/>To see what I mean by that, explore the audio folder in this repository. I have placed an audio as an example.
<br/>After you are done making directories for sounds,
<br/>place this script in the directory as I have placed it in this repository.
