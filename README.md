## Quick guide
1. For each type of sound, create a directory or folder in the audio/ directory.<br>
2. To see what I mean by that, explore the audio folder in this repository. I have placed an audio as an example.<br>
3. After you are done making directories for sounds,
<br/>place this script in the directory as I have placed it in this repository.
